# Botspark
A simple Twitch irc bot

Botspark is a simple irc bot for Twitch.tv.  It offers a graphical user interface that allows you to quickly and easily add or remove new commands.

When the application is first opened, you will need to open the Config menu and enter your Twitch username and add any commands that you would like Botspark to have.
These settings will be saved and loaded every time the application is opened thereafter.

Botspark comes with a "!commands" command that is automatically generated and lists all of the commands that have been added to Botspark. When a user in your Twitch.tv channel
enters "!command" in the chat, Botspark will respond with the complete list of commands that have been added.

Please do not add Botspark to any channels that are not yours unless you have permission from the broadcaster of that channel to do so.

Thank you for using Botspark!
